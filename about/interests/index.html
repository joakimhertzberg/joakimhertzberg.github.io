    <h1> # Interests </h1>

    <h2> ## Mathematics </h2>
      <p class = "description"> I am since a long time a mathematics-interested person, I love being able to use
      mathematical tools to analyse and solve problems. In upper-secondary school, I took
      a specialisation course which taught me linear algebra, since then, I've been actively
      profiling my education towards mathematics-oriented courses. </p>

    <h2> ## Physics </h2>
      <p class="description"> Physics is nothing but mathematics applied to the real world, so my interest in it 
      comes naturally from my interest in maths. The parts of physics I find the most fascinating
      are theoretical physics, I like dealing in relativity and the quantum. </p>

    <h2> ## Computer Science & Programming </h2>
      <p class="description"> I have had an interest for programming since many years, in later years. I have 
      started working on open source projects, and taken courses, most notably CS50x, for
      which I made this website! </p>

    <h2> ## Scouting </h2>
      <p class="description"> Having been an active scout for a long time, and now being a scout leader, both
      for children directly and as a member of my scout corp's board, I have great engangement
      in scouting. Scouting has taught me many valuable life skills, therein problem-solving and
      leadership. </p>

    <h2> ## Amateur Radio & Electronics </h2>
      <p class="description"> I am a recent radio amateur (a.k.a. HAM), who now does simple radio stuff and 
      electronics. </p>

    <h2> ## Maritime & Sailing </h2>
      <p class="description"> Maritime has for a long time been a siginificant part of my family, 
      I aspire to become a Marine Engineer/ Naval Architect. </p>
